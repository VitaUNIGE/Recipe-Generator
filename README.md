# Recipe Generator
Authors : Alexandre Tchittarath, Vitalia Vedenikova, Mohammad Hossein Ghaeb

## Idea behind the project
In order to make our lives easier and to help us make healthier choices, we developped a "Recipe Generator". Using our ShinyApp, anyone can input basic ingredients that they have in their fridge and chose among the recipes generated based on that input. Cooking time and calories amount help further filter which recipe to chose. Since this tool was made to be practical, only "quick and easy" recipes were extracted for this project. Furthermore, we narrowed down the number of ingredients to the most common ones found in the kitchen. 

## Instructions on how to run the code in RStudio 
First run the extraction codes before running the Frontend and Server part of the code. This first part might take a few minutes considering the considerable amount of data to be extracted. A smaller sample size (up to 3 pages of the scraped website) works best, but can be increased for a maximum amount of information.

## Instructions on how to use the ShinyApp
The ShinyApp itself is quite straight-forward. On the left, you may select the ingredients currently at your disposal. The scroll down menu generated will allow you to select a recipe. Once selected, the complete list of ingredients, recipes instructions, cooking time and calories will appear on the screen.
