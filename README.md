# Idea behind the project
In order to make our lives easier and to help us make healthier choices, we developped a "Recipe Generator". Using this tool, anyone can input basic ingredients that they have in their fridge and chose among the recipes generated based on that input. Cooking time and calories amount help further filter which recipe to chose. Since this tool was made to be practical, only "quick and easy" recipes were extracted for this project.
